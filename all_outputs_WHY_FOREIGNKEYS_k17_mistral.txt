Question: In which building is the class 401?
The class 401 is in the Electronics building, as per the context provided.

============================================================

Question: In which semester is done the Cybersecurity course?
The course "Cybersecurity" or "Cybersecurity Challenges" is associated with the semester "Spring". However, in your data, there's no direct mention of a course named "Cybersecurity". But based on the research area of the thesis titled "IoT Security Challenges", which was completed by student 3 and teacher 9 (Giulia Colombo), it can be inferred that the related course might have been offered in Spring. This is because the teacher Giulia Colombo teaches courses like Software Engineering (Spring) and Embedded Systems (Fall). Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that she could also teach a Cybersecurity course in Spring. But remember, this is an inference based on the given data.

============================================================

Question: In which classroom is the Database Systems exam?
The answer is Classroom ID 2, as the exam for course ID 102 (which is the Database context's course) is scheduled in classroom ID 2.

Question: In which area is the \"User Experience Design in Web Apps\" thesis?
The thesis titled "User Interface Design for a Mobile Application" is under the research area of Human-Computer Interaction, which is taught by Maria Ferrari in the course with ID 110. Therefore, it can be inferred that the teacher of the thesis is also Maria Ferrari.

============================================================

Question: Which instructor teaches Machine Learning course?
The answer is Carlo, as the teacher with a research area of Machine Learning, which matches the course name you provided. However, in your data, Carlo's teacher ID is not specified. Here's how I found it:

1. I looked for the course with the name "Machine Learning" and found that its teacher is Alessandro Moretti (row 7).
2. Then, I checked the teacher_research_areas data to find a teacher with Machine Learning as their research area. I found one with ID 8 (row 7), but since there's no teacher ID associated with "Alessandro Moretti" in the courses data, I couldn't directly link them.
3. However, since Alessandro Moretti is the only teacher teaching Machine Learning and he teaches in the Computer Science department, it can be reasonably assumed that Carlo (the teacher with a research area of Machine Learning) is likely Alessandro Moretti.

============================================================

Question: Which is the research area of the teacher Carlo Rossi?
The context provided does not contain information about a teacher named "Carlo Rossi" and his research area. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer regarding Carlo Rossi's research area. To find the answer, you would need to check the data related to Carlo Rossi in the 'csv_data/teachers.csv' and 'csv_data/teacher_research_areas.csv' files.

============================================================

Question: How many research project follows the teacher Giulia Colombo?

Question: When is the machine learning exam?
The course "Advanced Algorithms" (course_id: 104) is taught by Elisa Neri and it's in the Spring semester. However, there are no exams listed for this course in the provided data. It might be that the exam information is not available yet or it could be held outside the scope of the given data. To find out when the exam will take place, you should check with your university or professor directly.

============================================================

Question: In which courses Giulia Rossi is enrolled?
The given data shows a list of teachers and students, along with their details such as names, emails, and the courses they are associated with. To find out which courses Giulia Colombo (who is also known as Giulia in this dataset) teaches, we need to look for her name in the 'teacher' field of each course.

In the provided data, Giulia Colombo (teacher_id: 6) is associated with the course "Software Engineering" (course_id: 106). Therefore, she teaches the Software Engineering course.

============================================================

Question: What is the grade of Giulia Rossi for the Machine Learning course?
The context does not provide information about Giulia Rossi's grade for the Machine Learning course. To find this information, you would need to check the 'grades.csv' file and look for a row where the student_id matches Giulia Rossi (id=1) and the course_id matches Machine Learning (course_id=101). However, since the context does not include that specific data, I cannot provide an answer at this time.

============================================================

Question: Who is the teacher following Sophie Durand in her thesis?
The given data does not provide information about which teacher is supervising or teaching a specific student's project, so it is impossible to determine who Giulia Rossi's advisor or supervisor is based on the provided data. To find this information, you would need additional context or data that specifies the relationship between students and their advisors or supervisors.

============================================================

Question: What are all the courses offered by the Computer Science department?
The courses offered in the Computer Science department of the Engineering faculty are: Machine Learning, Database Systems, Software Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction, Cybersecurity, Advanced Algorithms, Digital Signal Processing, Data Mining, and Artificial Intelligence.

Question: What is the title of the thesis followed by Alessandro Moretti?
The context provided does not contain information about the thesis title of a student whose surname is Rossi. However, from the data, we know that there are two students named Giulia Rossi and Carlo Rossi. Since the question asks for the thesis title of a student whose surname is Rossi, it seems that more specific context or information is needed to provide an accurate answer.

============================================================

Question: Which students have an enrollment date before 2022?
The students who enrolled before 2022 are Lucas Schmidt (id: 4) and Marco Bianchi (id: 2). However, only Lucas Schmidt's enrollment date is before 2021 (2020-08-25), so he is the student who enrolled before 2021.
