        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:
            "{{<table_name>_<row>}}"
        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:
            "{{<table_name>_<row>}}"
        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:
            "{{<table_name>_<row>}}"
        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:
            "{{<table_name>_<row>}}"
        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:
            "{{<table_name>_<row>}}"
        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:
            "{{<table_name>_<row>}}"
        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:
            "{{<table_name>_<row>}}"
        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:
            "{{<table_name>_<row>}}"
        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:
            "{{<table_name>_<row>}}"
        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:
            "{{<table_name>_<row>}}"
        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:

        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:
            "{{<table_name>_<row>}}"
        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:
            "{{<table_name>_<row>}}"
        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:
            "{{<table_name>_<row>}}"
        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:
            "{{<table_name>_<row>}}"
        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.

        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:
            "{{<table_name>_<row>}}"
        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:

        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:
            "{{<table_name>_<row>}}"
        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:
            "{{<table_name>_<row>}}"
        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:
            "{{<table_name>_<row>}}"
        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:
            "{{<table_name>_<row>}}"
        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:
            "{{<table_name>_<row>}}"
        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:

        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:
            "{{<table_name>_<row>}}"
        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.

        2. For each answer, explain WHY it appears using **Witness Sets**: minimal sets of input tuples that justify the result.

        Each Witness Set must be a string like:
            "{{<table_name>_<row>}}"
        (use `source`(return just the table_name which correspond to the name of the file,WITHOUT extension and path csv_data/TABLENAME.csv
        ) and `row` metadata from the context).

        If an answer has multiple Witness Sets, list each one in the `"why"` array "{{WitnessSet1}, {WitnessSet2}}". A result is valid if at least one Witness Set supports it.
        IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON array with NO explanations or extra text.
        Do NOT include any comments, explanations, or introductory phrases.
