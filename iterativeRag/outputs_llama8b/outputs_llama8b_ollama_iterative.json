        "answer": "Here is the correct answer and explanation:\n\n[\n    {\n        \"answer\": [\"201\"],\n        \"why\": [\n            \"{{classrooms_2}}\",\n            \"{{classrooms_5}}\"\n        ]\n    }\n]\n\nExplanation:\nThe question asks for classrooms in the Science or Electronics building. The given answer is 401, which belongs to the Electronics building. However, since we are looking for rooms in either the Science or Electronics building, we also need to consider room 201 from the Science building.\n\nWitness sets that justify this result:\n\n* {{classrooms_2}}: This refers to the row with classroom_id=3 and building=Science, which corresponds to room 201.\n* {{classrooms_5}}: This refers to the row with classroom_id=6 and building=Electronics, which corresponds to room 401."
