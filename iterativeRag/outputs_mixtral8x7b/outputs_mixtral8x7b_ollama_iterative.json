This information does not directly contribute to the answer but is necessary to establish that teacher ID 1 (who teaches Machine Learning) has no direct association with Lucas Schmidt.\n- students row 3, which contains the details of student Lucas Schmidt. Although this tuple does not explicitly state that Lucas Schmidt is enrolled in either course, it is included as a witness set because it provides the necessary information to identify the student.\n\nSince there are no other tuples associating any students with the Machine Learning or Advanced Algorithms courses, \"Lucas Schmidt\" is currently the only answer based on the given context."

The teachers who meet these criteria are:\n- Teacher ID 1, Artificial Intelligence\n- Teacher ID 5, Signal Processing\n- Teacher ID 7, Data Mining\n\nWe can then look at the \"teachers\" table to find the corresponding names and surnames of these instructors. They are:\n- Teacher ID 1: Name: Maria, Surname: Ferrari\n- Teacher ID 5: Not explicitly given in the provided context\n- Teacher ID 7: Not explicitly given in the provided context\n\nTherefore, our answer is:\n\n[\n    {\n        \"answer\": [\"Maria Ferrari\", \"<Teacher 5's name>\", \"<Teacher 7's name>\"],\n        \"why\": [\n            \"{{teacher_research_areas_0}}\",\n            \"{{teachers_9}}\"\n        ]\n    }\n]\n\nNote: I assume that the system will replace <Teacher X's name> with the correct names once the teachers are identified in the provided context."
