The context only provides information about teachers and students, but not directly about who is involved in writing a thesis together. However, since the question specifies \"following\" in the context of a thesis, it implies that this must be the advisor or supervisor of the thesis.\nThe name of Sophie Durand's teacher is Carlo Rossi, as stated in row 0 of the teachers table. Therefore, the answer to the question is \"Carlo Rossi\". The witness set for this answer is {{teachers\\_0}}, which refers to the data in row 0 of the teachers table."

The closest match is Lucas Schmidt (student\\_id: 4) who has an ongoing thesis in the area of Human-Computer Interaction, but his grades are not specified in the context.\n\nHere are the witness sets that support this answer:\n\n- For all courses, only the number of credits and the teacher are provided, but no student grades. Therefore, there is no direct evidence to find a student with a grade of 28 in Human-Computer Interaction.\n- The row for Lucas Schmidt (students table, row: 3) does not contain any information about his grade in Human-Computer Interaction.\n- Row 9 in teacher\\_research\\_areas confirms that Human-Computer Interaction is a research area for teacher\\_id: 10 but does not provide any student grades.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[\n{\n\"answer\": [\"No such student found\"],\n\"why\": [\n\"{{teacher\\_research\\_areas_9}}\",\n\"{{courses_7, students_3}}\"\n]\n}\n]"

The answer \"Lucas Schmidt\" is justified by the witness set {{teacher\\_research\\_areas\\_7, courses\\_3}} because row 7 of teacher\\_research\\_areas indicates that teacher 8 has Machine Learning as a research area and row 3 of courses shows that course 104 (Machine Learning) is taught by teacher 1 in the fall semester. The student Lucas Schmidt is enrolled in this course as indicated in row 3 of students.\n2. The answer \"John Doe\" is justified by the witness set {{teacher\\_research\\_areas\\_0, courses\\_0}} because row 0 of teacher\\_research\\_areas indicates that teacher 1 has Artificial Intelligence as a research area and row 0 of courses shows that course 101 (Machine Learning) is taught by teacher 1 in the fall semester.
