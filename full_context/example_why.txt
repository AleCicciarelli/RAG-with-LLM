--- Question 47 ---
Which are the students (name, surname) enrolled in Human-Computer Interaction or Digital Signal Processing

Answer:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which students are enrolled in either Human-Computer Interaction or Digital Signal Processing based on the given context. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the courses mentioned. From the context, there's a course with ID 110 named "Human-Computer Interaction" and another with ID 105 called "Digital Signal Processing". So, any student enrolled in either of these two courses is relevant.

Next, I need to check the enrollments. The enrollments table has rows that link students to courses. Let me go through each enrollment row:

1. Enrollment row 6: Student ID 5 is enrolled in course 110 (Human-Computer Interaction) on 2022-02-14.
2. Enrollment row 4: Student ID 4 is enrolled in course 105 (Digital Signal Processing) on 2020-08-25.
3. Enrollment row 8: Student ID 9 is enrolled in course 110 again, but wait, looking at the students table, I don't see a student with ID 9. Hmm, maybe that's an error or perhaps the student isn't listed here. So I can ignore this one since there's no corresponding student data.
4. Enrollment row 7: Student ID 8 is enrolled in course 110 on 2021-01-10. Again, checking the students table, there's no student with ID 8, so this might be irrelevant or an error.

So, focusing on enrollments that have matching student IDs:

- Student ID 5 is enrolled in Human-Computer Interaction.
- Student ID 4 is enrolled in Digital Signal Processing.

Now, I'll look up these student IDs in the students table to get their names and surnames.

For Student ID 5: The row 4 in students shows Elena Gonzalez. So her full name is Elena Gonzalez.

For Student ID 4: Row 3 in students shows Lucas Schmidt. His full name is Lucas Schmidt.

Wait, but earlier I thought about enrollment row 8 (student 9) and row 7 (student 8), but since those students aren't present in the provided context, they can't be included. So only student IDs 5 and 4 are valid.

Therefore, the students enrolled in either of the two courses are Elena Gonzalez and Lucas Schmidt.
</think>

The answer is based on matching course IDs from enrollments to their respective student records.

```json
{
    "answer": ["Elena Gonzalez", "Lucas Schmidt"],
    "why": [
        "{{courses_9,enrollments_6,students_4}}",
        "{{courses_4,enrollments_4,students_3}}"
    ]
}
```

[DEBUG] LLM RESPONSE:
<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out which courses have exams scheduled at either 13:00 or 14:00 hours. Let me look through the given context step by step.

First, I see there are two sources: 'courses' and 'exams'. Each has a few rows of data. My goal is to find course names where their corresponding exam times match the specified hours.

Looking at the exams source:

- Row 1 in exams shows an exam for course ID 102 on 2023-02-15 at 14:00.
- Row 4 in exams shows an exam for course ID 106 on 2023-05-30 at 13:00.

Now, I need to find the corresponding course names from the courses source. 

For course ID 102, checking the courses source:

- Row 1 has course ID 102 and name "Database Systems".

For course ID 106, checking the courses source:

- Row 5 has course ID 106 and name "Software Engineering".

So both these courses have exams at either 13:00 or 14:00. Therefore, their names should be included in the answer.

Each of these results is supported by a combination of an exam tuple and its corresponding course tuple. So the witness sets will pair each relevant row from exams with the matching row from courses.
</think>

The correct answer includes the courses "Database Systems" and "Software Engineering". Each is linked to an exam at 14:00 and 13:00 respectively.

```json
{
    "answer": ["Database Systems", "Software Engineering"],
    "why": [
        "{{exams_1,courses_1}}",
        "{{exams_4,courses_5}}"
    ]
}
```
