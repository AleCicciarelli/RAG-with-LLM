Based on this assumption, one possible answer to your question is:\n\n1. Sophie Germain (research area: Mathematics): Sophie Germain was a French mathematician who made significant contributions to number theory and algebra. She was the first woman to win a prize from the French Academy of Sciences for her work on Fermat's theorem.\n2. Ada Lovelace (research area: Computing Science): Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognized as the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine, and she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.\n3. Rosalind Franklin (research area: Biology): Rosalind Franklin was an English chemist and X-ray crystallographer who made significant contributions to understanding the molecular structures of DNA, RNA, viruses, coal, and graphite. Her work on the structure of DNA was central to the development of the DNA model.\n4. Marie Curie (research area: Physics): Marie Curie was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win the Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two different scientific fields—Physics and Chemistry.\n5. Grace Hopper (research area: Computing Science): Grace Hopper was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first linkers. Hopper was the first to devise the concept of machine-independent programming languages, and the FLOW-MATIC programming language she created using this concept was later extended to create COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today.\n6. Chien-Shiung Wu (research area: Physics): Chien-Shiung Wu was a Chinese-American physicist who made significant contributions in the field of nuclear physics. She is known for her role in disproving the law of conservation of parity, for which she was awarded the Wolf Prize in Physics.\n7. Hedy Lamarr (research area: Computing Science): Hedy Lamarr was an Austrian-American film actress and inventor. She is credited with helping to develop a radio guidance system for Allied torpedoes during World War II, which used spread spectrum and frequency hopping technology to defeat jamming by the Axis powers.\n8. Rachel Carson (research area: Environmental Science): Rachel Carson was an American marine biologist, author, and conservationist whose book Silent Spring and other writings are credited with advancing the global environmental movement.\n9. Maryam Mirzakhani (research area: Mathematics): Maryam Mirzakhani was an Iranian mathematician and professor at Stanford University. She is known for her work on complex geometry, hyperbolic geometry, and ergodic theory, and in 2014 she became the first woman to be awarded the Fields Medal, the most prestigious award in mathematics.\n10. Katherine Johnson (research area: Computing Science): Katherine Johnson is an African-American mathematician whose calculations of orbital mechanics as a NASA employee were critical to the success of the first and subsequent U.S. crewed spaceflights. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015.\n\nNote: The research areas listed for each person are not necessarily the only fields they worked in, but rather the most relevant one based on the data provided."
