We then filter for rows where the thesis status is either \"Completed\" or \"In Progress\".

However, there is no direct question or context provided for me to generate a specific answer. \n\nNonetheless, I can provide some insights based on the data:\n\n1. There are multiple courses in which students are enrolled, with course IDs ranging from 101 to 110. Course details (e.g., course name, credits) are not provided in this dataset.\n2. Student IDs range from 1 to 5, and some basic information about the students is given in the 'students' CSV file.\n3. Teacher IDs range from 1 to 10, and their names, department IDs, and email addresses are provided in the 'teachers' CSV file.\n4. Department ID 1 corresponds to Computer Science, which is part of the Engineering faculty.\n5. Enrollment dates range from 2020-08-25 to 2022-10-15, indicating that the data covers a time frame of at least two academic years.\n6. Some students are enrolled in multiple courses (e.g., student_id 3 is enrolled in three different courses).\n7. There are no direct relationships between teachers and course IDs in this dataset, so it's not possible to determine which teacher teaches a specific course directly from the provided data.\n\nIf you have a specific question or scenario related to this data, please provide more context, and I will be happy to help."
