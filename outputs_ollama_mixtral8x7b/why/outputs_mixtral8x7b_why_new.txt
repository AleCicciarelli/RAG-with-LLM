Question:What is the name of building in which there is the class with room number 401? 
Answer:{'answer': 'Based on the given context, the answer to the question "What is the name of the building in which there is the class with room number 401?" is:\n\n```json\n"answer": ["classrooms"],\n"why": [\n    "{{classrooms_5}}"\n]\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe context contains a tuple from a hypothetical `classrooms.csv` file, where the source field is set to `\'classrooms\'`, and the row field is 5. This tuple provides information about a class held in room number 401. Since this information comes from the `classrooms` table, it implies that the building name can be obtained from the same table, which is why the answer is `"answer": ["classrooms"]`. The witness set for this answer is `"{{classrooms_5}}"`, indicating that the specific tuple at row 5 of the `classrooms` table provides justification for this answer.'}

Answer:{'answer': '[\n    "102"\n],\n"why": [\n    "{{exams_1, courses_1, classrooms_1}}"\n]\n\nExplanation:\nThe \'exams\' table (row 1) tells us that the Database Systems exam is held in room 102. This information is contained in the \'classrooms\' table (row 1), which associates room number 102 with building Main and capacity 60. The fact that this is indeed the correct room for the Database Systems exam is confirmed by the \'courses\' table (row 1), which lists room 102 as the location for the Database Systems course.'}

This information is used as one part of the witness set. The other part of the witness set comes from the `teacherResearchAreas` table, where there is a row (also row 5) that associates research area ID 5 with the teacher in row 5 of the `teachers` table. Since this teacher\'s name is "Giulia Colombo", and since she has at least one associated research project (research area ID 5), the answer is 1.\n\nThe witness set for this answer consists of the two rows from the context: `{teachers_5, teacherResearchAreas_5}`.'}

Question:In which courses (name of courses) Giulia Rossi is enrolled? 
Answer:{'answer': 'Answer: ["Machine Learning"]\nWhy: \n"{{courses_0, enrollments_0, students_0}}"\n\nExplanation: The answer is based on the information from the \'courses\', \'enrollments\', and \'students\' tables. Specifically, the course with ID 101 (Machine Learning) in the first row of the \'courses\' table has a student with ID 1 enrolled, as shown in the first row of the \'enrollments\' table. The \'students\' table then confirms that this student is named Giulia Rossi.
