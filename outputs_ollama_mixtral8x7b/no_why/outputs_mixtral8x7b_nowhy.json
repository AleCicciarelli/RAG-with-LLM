Question:How many research project follows the teacher Giulia Colombo? 
Answer:{'answer': '1\n\\* The context includes a row from \'teachers\' source with \'Giulia\' and \'Colombo\' as values in the appropriate columns, indicating this is about teacher Giulia Colombo.\n\\* The row from \'teacherResearchAreas\' source indicates that there are 5 research projects for the current teacher (Giulia Colombo).\n\\* However, the question asks for "research project**s**", which implies plural and more than one. This discrepancy between the expected answer format and the provided context makes it impossible to give a definitive correct answer without introducing assumptions.\n\\* Nonetheless, if we are to provide an answer based on the most direct interpretation of the context, it would be:\n1\n\\* Since there is no explicit mention of multiple projects for Giulia Colombo in the provided context, assuming that she has only one research project would not introduce any information not already implied.'}
