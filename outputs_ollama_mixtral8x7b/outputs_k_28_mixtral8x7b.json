The relevant information for the courses taught by \"Giuseppe Rossi\" is as follows:\n\n1. Course Name: Introduction to Programming\n2. Department: Computer Science\n3. Credits: 6\n4. Teacher: 1 (which corresponds to \"Giuseppe Rossi\")\n5. Semester: Fall\n\nTherefore, the answer is the course \"Introduction to Programming\" taught by \"Giuseppe Rossi\" in the Fall semester."
