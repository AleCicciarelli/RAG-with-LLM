Machine Learning: This course is associated with the course_id 101 and is taught by a teacher with the teacher_id 1 (Carlo Rossi). The department for this course is 1, and it's offered in the Fall semester.\n\n2. Advanced Algorithms: This course is associated with the course_id 104 and is taught by a teacher with the teacher_id 4 (Elisa Neri). The department for this course is 1, and it's offered in the Spring semester.\n\nNow, let's find out which students are enrolled in these courses:\n\n1. Machine Learning: The students enrolled in this course can be found by looking at the 'student_id' field in the rows where 'course_id' is 101. From the data you provided, student with 'student_id' 1 (Giulia Rossi) is enrolled in this course.\n\n2. Advanced Algorithms: Similarly, the students enrolled in this course can be found by looking at the 'student_id' field in the rows where 'course_id' is 104. From the data you provided, there are no direct mappings between 'student_id' and 'course_id' for this course. However, since we have a mapping between 'teacher_id' and 'course_id', we can potentially look at which students are associated with the teacher of this course to get an idea of who might be enrolled in it.\n\nPlease note that without more information on student enrollments, I cannot provide a definitive answer for who is enrolled in \"Advanced Algorithms\" course."
