We also need to count the number of distinct `student_id` values for each group:\n```vbnet\nSELECT d.department_name, COUNT(DISTINCT s.student_id) as num_students\nFROM students s\nJOIN departments d ON s.department_id = d.department_id\nGROUP BY d.department_name;\n```\nThis will give us the following result:\n```diff\n department_name | num_students\n----------------+--------------\n Electronics    |            3\n Mathematics    |            1"

Here is the SQL query to achieve this:\n```sql\nSELECT s.student_name, c.course_name \nFROM enrollments e \nJOIN students s ON e.student_id = s.student_id \nJOIN courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id \nWHERE (e.course_id = 104 OR e.course_id = 105) AND e.enrollment_date BETWEEN '2022-09-01' AND '2023-08-31'\n```\nThe result of this query is:\n```diff\n student_name |     course_name     \n--------------+---------------------\n Marco Rossi  | Machine Learning"
