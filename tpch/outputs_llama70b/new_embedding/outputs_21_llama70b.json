Join the customer, order, and lineitem tables to link customers with their orders and order items.\n2. Filter the results to include only customers from nation '2' (assuming nation key 2 corresponds to the desired nation).\n3. Calculate the total price for each order by summing the extended prices of its line items.\n4. Filter the results to include only orders with a total price between $2000 and $3000.\n\nHere's a sample SQL query to achieve this:\n```sql\nSELECT o_custkey, o_totalprice\nFROM (\n  SELECT l_orderkey, SUM(l_extendedprice) AS o_totalprice\n  FROM customer\n  JOIN orders ON c_custkey = o_custkey\n  JOIN lineitem ON o_orderkey = l_orderkey\n  WHERE c_nationkey = 2\n  GROUP BY l_orderkey\n) AS order_totals\nWHERE o_totalprice BETWEEN 2000 AND 3000;\n```\nPlease note that this is a simplified example and may require modifications to fit the exact schema and requirements of your database."
