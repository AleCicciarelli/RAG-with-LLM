After analyzing the provided context, I found that ASIA is the only continent mentioned.\n\nThe Witness Sets justify this result:\n\n* `{{nation_75}}`: This row from the \"nation\" table mentions ASIA as a continent.\n* `{{supplier_637}}`: Although not directly mentioning ASIA, this row from the \"supplier\" table provides additional context that supports the existence of ASIA as a continent.\n\nNote: Since there is only one answer, I provided a single Witness Set. If there were multiple answers or Witness Sets, they would be listed accordingly."
