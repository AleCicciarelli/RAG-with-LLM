Question:What are the order date of the order placed by customer 'Customer#000000023'? 
Answer:Based on the given context, I can see that there are two types of data: customer information and order information. The customer information includes a unique identifier ("Customer#000000023" in this case), while the order information includes an order key (e.g., "14947", "181028", etc.) and a total price.

To answer your question, I need to find the order keys that match the given customer ID ("Customer#000000023") and have a total price between 20500 and 20550. After searching through the order information, I found two orders that meet these criteria:

* Order key: "14947" with a total price of 178304.39
* Order key: "315492" with a total price of 203872.42

However, neither of these orders has a total price between 20500 and 20550. It seems that there are no orders that meet the specified criteria.

Therefore, my answer is:

"No order keys match the given customer ID ('Customer#000000023') and have a total price between 20500 and 20550."
