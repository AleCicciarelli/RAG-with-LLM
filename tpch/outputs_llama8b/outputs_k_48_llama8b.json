The account balances appear to be affected by these comments. For example, some comments mention \"final requests\" or \"pending deposits\", which could indicate that the account balance is being updated based on the completion of a request or the arrival of a deposit. Similarly, other comments mention \"regular excuses\" or \"ironic, pending deposits\", which could suggest that the account balance is being adjusted due to some kind of exception or irregularity.\n\nOverall, it appears that the comments in the supplier data are providing context for the account balances, indicating whether the balance is being updated due to a specific event or process."
