(rest of the suppliers)\n]\n\ndesired_nation_key = 21\n\nmatching_suppliers = [supplier for supplier in suppliers if supplier['s_nationkey'] == desired_nation_key]\n```\n\nIn this example, `suppliers` is a list of dictionaries representing the suppliers. Each dictionary has two keys: `s_suppkey` and `s_nationkey`. The `desired_nation_key` variable holds the value you're looking for (in this case, 21).\n\nThe list comprehension `[supplier for supplier in suppliers if supplier['s_nationkey'] == desired_nation_key]` creates a new list containing only the suppliers whose nation key matches the desired value.\n\nNow, let's apply this to your question:\n\nYou want to find the suppliers with nation key 21. Here are the matching suppliers:\n\n```\nmatching_suppliers = [\n    {'s_suppkey': 948, 's_nationkey': 21},\n    {'s_suppkey': 973, 's_nationkey': 21}\n]\n```\n\nThese are the suppliers that match your criteria."
