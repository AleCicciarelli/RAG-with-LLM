        "answer": "To answer this question, we need to find all suppliers with a balance lower than 0 and located in the EUROPE region. \n\nFrom the given context, we can see that there are several suppliers with negative balances. We just need to filter them by their nationkey (which corresponds to the region) and return their names.\n\nHere is the Python code to do this:\n\n```Python\ndef find_suppliers_with_negative_balance(context):\n    answer = []\n    for row in context:\n        if row['source'] == 'supplier' and float(row['row']) < 0:\n            answer.append(row['s_name'])\n    return {\"answer\": answer}\n\nprint(find_suppliers_with_negative_balance([{'source': 'nation', 'row': 18}, {'source': 'region', 'row': 2}, \n                                               {'source': 'supplier', 'row': 75, 's_name': 'Supplier#000000075'}, \n                                               ...]))\n```\n\nThis code will return a dictionary with the key \"answer\" and the value being a list of supplier names that have negative balances."

        "iteration": 2,
        "answer": "To answer this question, we need to find all suppliers with a negative total price. \n\nHere is the Python code that solves this problem:\n\n```Python\ndef which_suppliers(context):\n    result = []\n    for line in context:\n        if float(line.split(\",\")[5].strip().replace(\"$\", \"\")) < 0:\n            result.append(line.split(\",\")[1].strip().split(\": \")[1])\n    return {\"answer\": result}\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each line in the context, splits it into parts based on commas and spaces, converts the total price to a float, and checks if it's less than zero. If it is, it adds the supplier name (which is the second part of the line) to the result list.\n\nFinally, it returns a dictionary with the key \"answer\" and the value being the list of suppliers with negative total prices."

If both conditions are met, it adds the supplier's name to the result list. Finally, it returns a dictionary with the result.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use this function:\n\n```Python\ncontext = \"\"\"\n...
