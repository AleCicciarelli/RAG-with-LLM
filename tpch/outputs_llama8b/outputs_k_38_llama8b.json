This suggests that the suppliers may be involved in international transactions or have complex financial relationships.\n5. **Suppliers' characteristics**: The dataset likely contains a mix of small, medium, and large suppliers, with varying levels of financial stability and transaction activity.\n\n**What questions can be asked to gain more insights?**\n\n1. What is the distribution of account balances by nationkey?\n2. Are there any correlations between phone number patterns and supplier characteristics (e.g., nationkey, account balance)?\n3. Can we identify any specific industries or sectors represented in this dataset?\n4.
