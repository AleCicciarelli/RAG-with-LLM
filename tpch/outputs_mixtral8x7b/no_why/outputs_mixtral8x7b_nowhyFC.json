Question:Which customers (c_name) are from the market segment 'AUTOMOBILE' and have an account balance between 0 and 100? 
Answer:Based on the context provided, the question asks for the "customer row numbers" that match the criteria of having a market value between 0 and 100 and being in the "AUTOMOBILE" market segment. The relevant customer data is provided as a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing a customer and its attributes.

To find the customer row numbers that meet the criteria, we need to iterate through the list of customers and check if they meet the specified conditions. Here's how you can do it:

```python
# List of customer dictionaries
customers = [
    {"row_number": 1, "market_segment": "AUTOMOBILE", "market_value": 50},
    {"row_number": 2, "market_segment": "FURNITURE", "market_value": 200},
    {"row_number": 3, "market_segment": "AUTOMOBILE", "market_value": 120},
    # ... more customers ...
]

# Filter customers based on the given criteria
filtered_customers = [c for c in customers if c["market_segment"] == "AUTOMOBILE" and 0 <= c["market_value"] <= 100]

Question:What is the available quantity of the part blush thistle blue yellow saddle supplied by Supplier#000000003 
Answer:902

The available quantity of the part "blush thistle blue yellow saddle" supplied by Supplier#000000003 can be found in the 'part' source row 1: '1'. Since this supplier is specified in the question, we look at the 'supplier' source rows and find row 2 which contains the supplier number and its quantity on hand (q1), which is '11-383-516-1199' or '4192.4'. However, this value represents the total quantity of all parts supplied by this manufacturer, so we need to look at the 'partsupp' source rows for more information. Row 4 contains the supplier number '3', part number '2' (which corresponds to our part), and a quantity '8895'. Since the supplier quantity on hand is divided among all parts it supplies, we can calculate the available quantity of our part by multiplying the total supplier quantity on hand by the ratio of this part's quantity in the supplier's total quantity. This gives us (4192.4 / 11383) \* 8895 = 3670.4, but since we cannot have a fraction of a part, we round down to the nearest whole number: 3670. However, the question only asks for the available quantity based on the given context, which does not include 'partsupp' source row 4, so we can only provide the supplier's total quantity on hand for this part: 902 (the value in the 'part' source row).
