For example, I can calculate the average account balance, find suppliers from a particular country, or identify suppliers with negative account balances.\n\nHere's an example of how to find the average account balance:\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(s_acctbal) FROM supplier;\n```\nTo find suppliers from a specific nation (let's say nation key 18 as an example):\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM supplier WHERE s_nationkey = 18;\n```\nAnd to identify suppliers with negative account balances:\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM supplier WHERE s_acctbal < 0;\n```\nLet me know if you need help with anything else!"
