To find the order date for a specific 'suppkey', you would need to look at each record in the dataset and check if the 'suppkey' matches the one you are interested in. Here's how you would do that in Python using pandas:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming df is your DataFrame and 'suppkey' is the column with supplier keys\nsuppkey_of_interest = 813\n\norder_date = df[df['suppkey'] == suppkey_of_interest]['order_date'].iloc[0]\n\nprint(f\"The order date for suppkey {suppkey_of_interest} is: {order_date}\")\n```\n\nReplace `df` with your DataFrame, 'suppkey' with the correct column name if needed, and `suppkey_of_interest` with the 'suppkey' value you want to find the order date for. This code will print the order date for the specified suppkey."

Finally, it orders the results in descending order based on the total profit and limits the output to the top 5 customers.\n\nHowever, with the given data, I cannot execute this query since there are no customer or order details provided."
