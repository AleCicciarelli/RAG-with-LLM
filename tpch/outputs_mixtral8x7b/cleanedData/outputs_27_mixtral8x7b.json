Supplier#00001300. Can you find the total sum of all the numbers in this list?\n\nHere's a hint: the number after Supplier#00000289 is 488.\n*/\n\nLet's analyze the pattern here:\n- The number increases by 1 every 3 suppliers, starting from 1.\n- After supplier #00000289, the next number is 488, which is 51 more than expected (since 289/3 = 96.33, and we would expect a jump of 1 after 97*3=291). This means that there was an extra supplier inserted between #00000289 and #00000290, causing the pattern to shift by 1.\n- Therefore, the correct position of each supplier in the sequence is its apparent position plus the number of \"extra\" suppliers inserted before it. In this case, there are 50 extra suppliers (from the 51-number jump), so we need to add 50 to the apparent position of every supplier after #00000289.\n\nNow let's calculate the sum:\n- The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula Sum = n/2 * (a + l), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term.\n- There are 1300 - 289 + 1 = 1012 terms in total (we add 1 because the sequence starts from supplier #00000001).\n- The first term a is 1, and the last term l is 1300.\n- However, we need to adjust the positions of the terms after #00000289 as described above. This means that the actual sequence starts from supplier #00000001, then jumps to supplier #0000051 (which is the real supplier #00000290), and continues with increments of 3 thereafter.\n- Therefore, the formula for the sum becomes Sum = (289/2 * 1 + 723/2 * 3) + 50/2 * (1 + 1300) = 436265."
