The account balances vary significantly, with the lowest being 515.22 and the highest 9747.16.\n4. There are a few suppliers with very high account balances (over 5000), which might be interesting to analyze further.\n5. Some phone numbers contain an area code starting with 1, while others do not. This could indicate different formats or the absence of area codes in certain countries.\n6.
