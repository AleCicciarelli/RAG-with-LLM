        "question": "Which orders (o_orderkey) done by a customer with nationkey = 2 have a total price between 20500 and 20550?",
        "answer": "To answer your question, I need to analyze the data from the 'supplier' table you provided.\n\nThe table contains information about different suppliers, including their 'suppkey' (supplier key), name, address, nationkey (nation key), phone number, and account balance ('acctbal').\n\nHowever, your question is related to the 'customer' table, which is not provided in the data you shared. Therefore, I cannot provide an exact answer to your question using this data.\n\nTo find out the total number of customers who have made a purchase from supplier 100, we would need access to the 'customer' table and the 'orders' table (or any other table that links customers to their purchases). We would then look for all orders placed by customers with a link to supplier 100 and count the number of unique customers associated with those orders.\n\nWithout this information, I cannot provide an accurate answer to your question."

        "question": "Which customers (c_name) have placed orders with a total price between 91123 and 91130",
        "answer": "The information provided consists of various supplier data, but it does not seem to contain any order or transaction data that would allow us to determine which orders were placed by a specific customer with a nation key value of 23. In order to answer this question, we would need access to additional data such as order details or transaction history.\n\nUsing the given supplier data, we can see that there is one supplier with a nation key value of 23 (supplier #949). However, without further information about their orders or transactions, we cannot determine if this customer placed any orders with suppliers. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this question based on the provided data."

        "answer": "The answer to your question is not provided in the data you've given, which is a list of suppliers with their details. To find the answer, you would need to consult two other tables: `customers` and `orders`. The `customers` table would provide information about which customer has what nationkey, and the `orders` table would contain the order details including the customer key, order key, and order date.\n\nOnce you have this data, you can filter for orders that fall within a specific time range (e.g., the month of April 2020) and then find out which customer made those orders by joining the `orders` table with the `customers` table on the common key (customer key).\n\nHere's an example of how you might write this query in SQL:\n```sql\nSELECT c.customerName, o.orderKey\nFROM customers c\nJOIN orders o ON c.customerKey = o.customerKey\nWHERE o.orderDate BETWEEN '2020-04-01' AND '2020-04-30';\n```\nThis query would give you the names of customers who made orders in April 2020, along with the order keys for those orders. If you want to find out which customer made the most purchases during that time period, you could modify the query to group by customer name and sum the order keys:\n```vbnet\nSELECT c.customerName, COUNT(o.orderKey) as numOrders\nFROM customers c\nJOIN orders o ON c.customerKey = o.customerKey\nWHERE o.orderDate BETWEEN '2020-04-01' AND '2020-04-30'\nGROUP BY c.customerName\nORDER BY numOrders DESC;\n```\nThis query would give you a list of customers and the number of orders they made in April 2020, sorted from highest to lowest. The customer at the top of the list is the one who made the most purchases during that time period."

Here is an example of such a query:\n```\nSELECT p.product_name, o.order_status\nFROM orders o\nJOIN order_details od ON o.id = od.order_id\nJOIN products p ON od.product_id = p.id\nWHERE o.created_at BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2022-12-31'\nGROUP BY p.product_name, o.order_status;\n```\nThis query will return a table with two columns: `product_name` and `order_status`, along with the count of orders for each product and status combination. To get the total number of shipped and cancelled orders for each product, you can use the following modified version of the query:\n```\nSELECT p.product_name,\n       SUM(CASE WHEN o.order_status = 'shipped' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS shipped_orders,\n       SUM(CASE WHEN o.order_status = 'cancelled' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cancelled_orders\nFROM orders o\nJOIN order_details od ON o.id = od.order_id\nJOIN products p ON od.product_id = p.id\nWHERE o.created_at BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2022-12-31'\nGROUP BY p.product_name;\n```\nThis query will return a table with three columns: `product_name`, `shipped_orders`, and `cancelled_orders`, which show the total number of shipped and cancelled orders for each product, respectively. You can then use this information to calculate the percentage of shipped and cancelled orders for each product by dividing the number of shipped or cancelled orders by the total number of orders (i.e., the sum of `shipped_orders` and `cancelled_orders`).\n\nI hope this helps!

The information provided for each such supplier includes their supplier ID, name, account balance, and the ID and total value of at least one order they have processed.\n\nThe query first performs a left join between the `supplier` and `orders` tables on the `supplier.supplier_id = orders.supplier_id` condition. This allows us to combine information from both tables into a single result set, where each row corresponds to a supplier and their associated orders (if any).\n\nThe query then filters this result set to only include rows where the `nationkey` value is 5 (i.e., the United States) and the `supplier.balance` value is greater than 0 (i.e., the account balance is positive).\n\nFinally, for each row that meets these criteria, the query constructs a string that includes the supplier's ID, name, balance, and the ID and total value of their most recent order (if any). The string also includes the text \"and orders with\" to indicate that the information about the order(s) is being included as part of the description of the supplier.\n\nNote that if a supplier has not processed any orders, the resulting string will not include any information about orders (since there are none to include).

        "answer": "Based on the information provided, there is no direct relationship between the data of 'supplier' and the question about the 'orders' table. However, assuming that there is a need to find orders from customers of a specific nation where the supplier belongs, here is an answer:\n\nTo find orders from customers of a supplier's nation, you would first need to join the 'orders' table with the 'order_details' table on the common column 'order_id'. After that, you would join the result with the 'products' table using the 'product_code' and then join it with the 'suppliers' table using the 'supplier_id'. Finally, you can filter the results based on the nation key of the supplier.\n\nHere is a SQL query to achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT o.*\nFROM orders o\nJOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id\nJOIN products p ON od.product_code = p.product_code\nJOIN suppliers s ON p.supplier_id = s.supplier_id\nWHERE s.nation_key = <the nation key of the supplier>\n```\n\nReplace `<the nation key of the supplier>` with the actual nation key value to get the desired result.\n\nPlease note that this query assumes that the table and column names are as mentioned in your previous questions. If there are any changes, please adjust the query accordingly."
