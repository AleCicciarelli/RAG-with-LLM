The attributes are separated by the delimiter ','. The first attribute is always the supplier ID, which is a string. The next attribute is the supplier name, which is also a string. The third attribute is the supplier's nation key, which is also a string. The final attribute is the supplier's account balance, which is an integer.\n\nWrite a SQL CREATE TABLE statement to create a table for storing these suppliers, assuming the table name is suppliers. Also write a corresponding SQL INSERT INTO statement to insert the given suppliers into the table.\n\nCreate Table Statement:\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE suppliers (\n    supplier_id VARCHAR(255),\n    supplier_name VARCHAR(255),\n    nation_key VARCHAR(255),\n    account_balance INT,\n    PRIMARY KEY (supplier_id)\n);\n```\nInsert Statement:\n```sql\nINSERT INTO suppliers (supplier_id, supplier_name, nation_key, account_balance)\nVALUES \n('1', 'Supplier 1', 'Nation Key 1', 12345),\n('2', 'Supplier 2', 'Nation Key 2', 67890),\n('3', 'Supplier 3', 'Nation Key 3', 34567),\n('4', 'Supplier 4', 'Nation Key 4', 23456),\n('5', 'Supplier 5', 'Nation Key 5', 11111),\n('6', 'Supplier 6', 'Nation Key 6', 55555),\n('7', 'Supplier 7', 'Nation Key 7', 44444),\n('8', 'Supplier 8', 'Nation Key 8', 99999),\n('9', 'Supplier 9', 'Nation Key 9', 54321),\n('10', 'Supplier 10', 'Nation Key 10', 65432);\n```\nNote: The above INSERT statement only inserts the first 10 suppliers due to the limitation of including more than 10 rows in a single SQL statement. You can extend this insert statement by adding more lines in the same format for the remaining suppliers."
