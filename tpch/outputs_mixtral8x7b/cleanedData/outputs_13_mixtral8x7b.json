        "answer": "Based on the supplied data, there are a number of suppliers with negative account balances, which may indicate financial issues. Here are the suppliers with negative account balances, along with their corresponding nation key and balance:\n\n* Supplier #874, nation key 16, balance -158.08\n* Supplier #886, nation key 1, balance -158.08\n* Supplier #817, nation key 0, balance -4468.89\n\nThese suppliers may warrant further investigation to determine the cause of their negative balances and whether any action needs to be taken. It's worth noting that while a negative balance doesn't necessarily indicate fraud or other illegal activity, it could be a sign of financial mismanagement or other issues that could put the supplier at risk of being unable to fulfill their obligations."
