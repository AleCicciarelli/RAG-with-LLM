However, it is not valid Python code. If you want to create 100 supplier objects in Python, you could use a loop to repeatedly call a Supplier class constructor. Here's an example:\n\n```\nclass Supplier:\n    def __init__(self, suppkey, name, comment):\n        self.suppkey = suppkey\n        self.name = name\n        self.comment = comment\n\nsuppliers = []\nfor i in range(1, 101):\n    suppliers.append(Supplier(i, f'Supplier#0000000{i}', 'Comment for Supplier #0000000{i}'))\n\n```\n```"
