It seems that all deliveries are made by the same supplier (Rolfson, Kody) to the same address (with a variable number). The cost is always the same.\n\nIf we assume that there is one delivery per day, then this period lasts 55 days. If you prefer, I can compute the exact date range for you.\n\nThe total cost of these deliveries is 55 * -1229.89 = -67743.05 dollars. Since the cost is negative, this means that the receiver of the deliveries gets a refund or credit of this amount."
