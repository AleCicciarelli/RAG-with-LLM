        "question": "Which suppliers (s_name) belong to the region with r_name EUROPE and have a balance lower than 0?",
        "answer": "To find the answer, we need to join the 'orders' table and 'orderdetails' table with the 'products' table using the 'productcode' as the key. After that, we need to filter the records where the quantity ordered is greater than or equal to 10 and the price of each product is between 100 and 5000. Finally, we need to group the result by the product name and calculate the total revenue for each product. Here's the SQL query to do that:\n```vbnet\nSELECT p.productname, SUM(od.quantityordered * o.priceeach) as totalrevenue\nFROM orderdetails od\nJOIN orders o ON od.ordernumber = o.ordernumber\nJOIN products p ON od.productcode = p.productcode\nWHERE od.quantityordered >= 10 AND o.priceeach BETWEEN 100 AND 5000\nGROUP BY p.productname;\n```\nThe above query will return the list of product names along with their total revenue. However, based on the prompt, it seems like the answer should be a single value rather than a table. Therefore, we need to modify the query to return a single value using an aggregate function such as MAX or MIN (since there can only be one answer). Here's the modified query:\n```vbnet\nSELECT MAX(totalrevenue)\nFROM (\n    SELECT p.productname, SUM(od.quantityordered * o.priceeach) as totalrevenue\n    FROM orderdetails od\n    JOIN orders o ON od.ordernumber = o.ordernumber\n    JOIN products p ON od.productcode = p.productcode\n    WHERE od.quantityordered >= 10 AND o.priceeach BETWEEN 100 AND 5000\n    GROUP BY p.productname\n) t;\n```\nThe above query will return the maximum total revenue from all products that meet the criteria."

What is the average balance of suppliers in each nation?\n\nTo answer this question, we need to go through each supplier record and calculate the average balance of suppliers in each nation. Based on the given data, the average balance of suppliers in each nation is:\n\n* Nation key 0: 1000000\n* Nation key 1: 1955.97\n* Nation key 7: 1736.47\n* Nation key 9: 515.22\n* Nation key 15: (4139.88 + 2404.27) / 2 = 3272.075\n* Nation key 16: 5339.25\n* Nation key 21: (3689.14 + 1444.79) / 2 = 2566.965\n* Nation key 24: 6538.01\n\nTherefore, the average balance of suppliers in nations with keys 0, 1, 7, 9, 15, 16, 21, and 24 is 1000000, 1955.97, 1736.47, 515.22, 3272.075, 5339.25, 2566.965, and 6538.01, respectively.\n\nNote: The average balance for nation key 15 is calculated as the average of the two suppliers with that nation key."
