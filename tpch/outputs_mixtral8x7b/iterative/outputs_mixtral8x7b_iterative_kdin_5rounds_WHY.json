They help to explain why a particular answer appears in the output by identifying the specific tuples from the input data that led to the answer.\nFor Example 1:\nThe witness set for the first order key \"546\" would be {{customer\\_14322,orders\\_137}} because these two tuples together satisfy the condition of a customer with nationkey = 2 and an order total price between 20500 and 20550.\nSimilarly, for the second order key \"314052\", the witness set would be {{customer\\_101,orders\\_78528}} because these two tuples together satisfy the same condition.\nFor Example 2:\nThe witness set for the phone number \"21-151-690-3663\" would be {{supplier\\_4}} because this tuple alone justifies the answer since it contains the phone number of the supplier named 'Supplier#000000005'.\nIn general, Witness Sets help to provide transparency and accountability in query results by identifying the specific input tuples that led to the result."
