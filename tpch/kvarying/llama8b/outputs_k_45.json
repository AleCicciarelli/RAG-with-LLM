      "Based on the provided context, I can see that there are multiple records with different account balances. However, since you're asking for the account balance of a specific customer (custkey 456), I'll focus on finding that record.\n\nAfter reviewing the data, I found the following record:\n\n{'source': 'tpch/csv_data_tpch/customer.csv', 'row': 8485}\nc_custkey: 8481\nc_name: Customer#000008481\nc_address: yO7iwF H,RQWbihaT8XZD4h,y\nc_nationkey: 14\nc_phone: 24-242-492-1142\nc_acctbal: 7696.26\nc_mktsegment: HOUSEHOLD\n\nThis record has a custkey of 8481, which is not the desired value (456). However, I can't find any other records with a custkey matching 456.\n\nTherefore, my answer would be:\n\n{\n\"answer\": [\"No record found for customer with custkey 456\"]\n}\n\nPlease note that this answer assumes there are no duplicate custkeys or incorrect data. If you have any further information or clarification regarding the context, I'd be happy to help!"
