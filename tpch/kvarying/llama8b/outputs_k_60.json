      "Based on the provided context and question, I will provide the expected answer.\n\nQuestion: Which orders done by a customer with nationkey = 2 have a total price between 20500 and 20550?\n\nExpected Answer:\n```json\n{\n    \"answer\": [\"<answer_1>\", \"<answer_2>\", ...]\n}\n```\nAfter analyzing the provided context, I found that there are no orders done by a customer with nationkey = 2 that have a total price between 20500 and 20550. Therefore, the expected answer is an empty list.\n\nHere's the code to solve this problem:\n```python\nanswer = []\nfor row in data:\n    if row['o_custkey'] == 2 and 20500 <= row['o_totalprice'] <= 20550:\n        answer.append(row['o_orderkey'])\nprint({\"answer\": answer})\n```\nNote that this code assumes that the `data` variable contains the provided context, which is a list of dictionaries representing each order. The code iterates through the orders and checks if the customer nationkey is equal to 2 and the total price is between 20500 and 20550. If an order meets these conditions, its orderkey is added to the `answer` list. Finally, the code prints the expected answer as a JSON object."
