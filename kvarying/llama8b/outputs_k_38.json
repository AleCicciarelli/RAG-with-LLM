The same file also contains information about exams, specifically an exam with `exam_id` equal to 2 and `course_id` equal to 102 (which matches our Database Systems course).\n4. This exam is scheduled for `date` 2023-02-15 and `time` 14:00.\n5. The context also mentions a classroom with `classroom_id` equal to 6, `building` equal to \"Electronics\", and `room_number` equal to 401.\n\nPutting all these pieces together, I can conclude that the Database Systems exam is held in Room 401."
