Question:Which are the Female students (name, surname) enrolled in the university in the course with course_id 110? 
Answer:To answer this question, we need to find the student names and surnames corresponding to the student_ids enrolled in the course with course_id 110. 

From the given context, we can see that there are two enrollments for course_id 110:

- {'source': 'csv_data/enrollments.csv', 'row': 6}
enrollment_id: 7
student_id: 5
course_id: 110
enrollment_date: 2022-02-14

- {'source': 'csv_data/enrollments.csv', 'row': 8}
enrollment_id: 9
student_id: 4
course_id: 110
enrollment_date: 2020-08-25

However, the student names and surnames are not provided in the given context. We would need additional information from a "students.csv" file to answer this question.

If we had the students.csv data, we could provide the answer in the format:

[Name] [Surname]
[Name] [Surname]

But with the current context, it's not possible to provide the exact answer.
