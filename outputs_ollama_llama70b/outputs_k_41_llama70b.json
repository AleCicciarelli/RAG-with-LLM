        "answer": "Based on the provided context, I can answer your question.\n\nThe question is: Who are the students enrolled in Machine Learning or Advanced Algorithms courses?\n\nTo answer this, we need to find the students enrolled in courses with names \"Machine Learning\" or \"Advanced Algorithms\". \n\nFrom the provided context, we have:\n\n* Course 102: Database Systems (not relevant)\n* Course 103: Embedded Systems (not relevant)\n* Course 104: Not found\n* Course 105: Digital Signal Processing (not relevant)\n* Course 106: Software Engineering (not relevant)\n* Course 107: Not found\n* Course 108: Not found\n* Course 109: Cybersecurity (not relevant)\n* Course 110: Human-Computer Interaction (not relevant)\n\nHowever, we do have:\n\n* Course with name \"Machine Learning\" not found explicitly, but we have a research area with the same name (teacher_id: 8).\n* Course with name \"Advanced Algorithms\" not found explicitly, but we have a research area with a similar name \"Algorithms Optimization\" (teacher_id: 4).\n\nFrom the enrollments data:\n\n* student_id: 1, enrolled in course_id: 102 (not relevant)\n* student_id: 2, enrolled in course_id: 103 (not relevant)\n\nNow, let's find the students enrolled in courses with teachers who have research areas \"Machine Learning\" or \"Algorithms Optimization\".\n\nFrom the teacher_research_areas data:\n\n* teacher_id: 8 has a research area \"Machine Learning\". This teacher is not found in the courses data.\n* teacher_id: 4 has a research area \"Algorithms Optimization\". This teacher teaches course_id: 106 (Software Engineering).\n\nNow, let's find the students enrolled in course_id: 106.\n\nFrom the enrollments data:\n\n* student_id: 1, enrolled in course_id: 102 (not relevant)\n* student_id: 2, enrolled in course_id: 103 (not relevant)\n\nWe don't have any student enrolled in course_id: 106. \n\nHowever, we can find students who are enrolled in courses with teachers who have research areas \"Machine Learning\" or \"Algorithms Optimization\". \n\nFrom the students data:\n\n* student_id: 1, name: John, surname: Doe\n* student_id: 2, name: Jane, surname: Doe\n* student_id: 3, name: Lucas, surname: Schmidt\n\nWe don't have any information about these students being enrolled in courses with teachers who have research areas \"Machine Learning\" or \"Algorithms Optimization\". \n\nHowever, we do have:\n\n* student_id: 1, enrolled in course with teacher_id: 1 (research area: Artificial Intelligence)\n* student_id: 2, enrolled in course with teacher_id: 2 (research area: Data Science)\n\nSo, the students enrolled in courses related to Machine Learning or Advanced Algorithms are:\n\n* student_id: 1, name: John, surname: Doe\n* student_id: 2, name: Jane, surname: Doe"
