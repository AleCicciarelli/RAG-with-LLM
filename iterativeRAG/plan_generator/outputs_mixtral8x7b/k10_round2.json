        "answer": "{\n\"answer\": [\"<research_area_of_Carlo_Rossi>\"]\n}\n\n<research_area_of_Carlo_Rossi> is not provided directly in the context. However, we can infer it based on the 'department\\_id' field of Carlo Rossi and other teachers. The 'teacherResearchAreas.csv' file contains research areas associated with teacher IDs. By cross-referencing the department IDs from 'teachers.csv' and the teacher IDs in 'teacherResearchAreas.csv', we can find the research area of Carlo Rossi.\n\nTo get the correct answer, you need to perform a lookup using the department\\_id (1) in the teachers.csv file and match it with the teacher\\_id in the teacherResearchAreas.csv file. The correct answer will be the 'research\\_area' value associated with that teacher ID.\n\nThe following is an example of how to find the correct answer:\n\n1. Find the record with department\\_id = 1 in teachers.csv:\n   ```json\n   {'source': 'csv_data/teachers.csv', 'row': 0}\n   teacher_id: 1\n   name: Carlo\n   surname: Rossi\n   department_id: 1\n   email: c.rossi@university.edu\n   ```\n\n2. Find the record with the same teacher\\_id in teacherResearchAreas.csv:\n   ```json\n   {'source': 'csv_data/teacherResearchAreas.csv', 'row': <some_row_number>}\n   teacher_id: 1\n   research_area: <research_area_of_Carlo_Rossi>\n   number_of_project: <number_of_projects>\n   ```\n\nThe correct answer will be the 'research\\_area' value associated with Carlo Rossi. The actual row number in step 2 cannot be determined from the provided context, so you need to perform this lookup in your code."
