        "answer": "Based on the provided context, I can answer your question.\n\nTo find the students enrolled in courses from the Computer Science department, we need to look for enrollments where the course ID matches a course taught by a teacher from the Computer Science department. \n\nFrom the given data, we know that Giulia Rossi (student_id: 1) is enrolled in course 104 (department_id: 1), which is taught by Carlo Rossi (teacher_id: 1). Therefore, Giulia Rossi is enrolled in a course from the Computer Science department.\n\nAdditionally, Marco Bianchi (student_id: 2) is enrolled in course 102 (department_id: 1), which is also taught by Carlo Rossi. Hence, Marco Bianchi is enrolled in a course from the Computer Science department as well.\n\nSo, the answer to your question is:\n\nGiulia Rossi and Marco Bianchi are the students enrolled in courses from the Computer Science department."
