        "question": "which are the courses (name of the course) with an exam scheduled at 13.00 or 14.00 hours?",
        "answer": "Based on the provided context, I can answer your question.\n\nTo find the students who are enrolled in Machine Learning or Data Science courses, we need to identify the courses that match these topics. After analyzing the data, I found that there are no specific courses labeled as \"Machine Learning\" or \"Data Science\". However, we can look for courses that might be related to these topics.\n\nFrom the context, I found the following courses that might be relevant:\n\n* Course ID 101: Digital Signal Processing\n* Course ID 104: Digital Signal Processing (same as above)\n* Course ID 106: Software Engineering\n\nThese courses might not be directly labeled as Machine Learning or Data Science, but they could be related to these topics. To confirm the enrollment of students in these courses, we need to check the enrollments data.\n\nFrom the enrollments data, I found the following students enrolled in the relevant courses:\n\n* Student ID 1: Enrolled in Course ID 101\n* Student ID 2: Enrolled in Course ID 102 (not directly related to Machine Learning or Data Science)\n* Student ID 3: Enrolled in Course ID 104 and Course ID 106\n\nBased on this information, the students who are enrolled in courses that might be related to Machine Learning or Data Science are:\n\n* Student ID 1\n* Student ID 3 (twice)\n\nPlease note that this answer is based on the provided context and might not be exhaustive. If you have any further questions or would like me to clarify anything, feel free to ask!"
