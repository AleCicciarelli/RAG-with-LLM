This file contains information about each student's grades for a specific course.\n\nHere are the students enrolled in each of the mentioned courses:\n\n1. Embedded Systems (course_id 103):\n   - Student_id: 3\n\n2. Digital Signal Processing (course_id 105):\n   No students found in this course.\n\n3. Cybersecurity (course_id 109):\n   - Student_id: 9"
