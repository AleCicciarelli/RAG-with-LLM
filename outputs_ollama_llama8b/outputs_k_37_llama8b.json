        "answer": "Based on the provided context, I can answer your question.\n\nTo find the students enrolled in courses taught by teachers who have research areas related to Machine Learning, we need to identify the teachers with a research area of \"Machine Learning\" and then find their courses. \n\nFrom the teacher_research_areas.csv file, we can see that teacher_id 8 has a research area of \"Machine Learning\". From the courses.csv file, we can see that this teacher (id 9) teaches course_id 108 (\"Artificial Intelligence\") in the Spring semester.\n\nNow, let's find students enrolled in this course. From the thesis.csv file, we know that student_id 1 is enrolled in a thesis with title \"Deep Learning for Image Recognition\" and teacher_id 1. This means that student_id 1 is enrolled in course_id 108 (\"Artificial Intelligence\").\n\nFrom the courses.csv file, we can see that course_id 104 (\"Advanced Algorithms\") has teacher_id 4. From the thesis.csv file, we know that student_id 4 is enrolled in a thesis with title \"Autonomous Systems\" and teacher_id 3. This means that student_id 4 is also enrolled in course_id 104 (\"Advanced Algorithms\").\n\nSo, the students enrolled in courses taught by teachers who have research areas related to Machine Learning are:\n\n1. Student_id 1 (enrolled in course_id 108)\n2. Student_id 4 (enrolled in course_id 104)\n\nThe answer is: Student_id 1 and Student_id 4."

        "answer": "Based on the provided context, I can help answer your question.\n\nTo find the students enrolled in courses related to \"Machine Learning\" or \"Advanced Algorithms\", we need to look at the enrollments.csv file and filter out the rows where course_id matches either 104 (Advanced Algorithms) or 103 (Machine Learning).\n\nHere's the relevant data from the enrollments.csv file:\n\n| enrollment_id | student_id | course_id | enrollment_date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 1 | 102 | 2022-09-01 |\n| 2 | 1 | 104 | 2022-09-01 |\n| 3 | 2 | 103 | 2021-01-10 |\n| 4 | 4 | 105 | 2020-08-25 |\n\nFrom this data, we can see that student_id 1 is enrolled in course_id 102 and 104. Student_id 2 is enrolled in course_id 103. And student_id 4 is enrolled in course_id 105.\n\nSo, the students enrolled in courses related to \"Machine Learning\" or \"Advanced Algorithms\" are:\n\n* Student_id 1 (giulia.rossi@student.edu)\n* Student_id 2 (sophie.durand@student.edu)\n\nPlease note that these answers are based on the provided context and might not be exhaustive or accurate if there's more information available."
