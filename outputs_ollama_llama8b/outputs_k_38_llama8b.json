        "answer": "Based on the provided context, I can answer your question.\n\nTo find the students enrolled in courses related to Machine Learning, we need to identify the courses that have \"Machine Learning\" as their research area or are taught by teachers who have \"Machine Learning\" as one of their research areas.\n\nFrom the given data, we can see that:\n\n* Teacher 8 has \"Machine Learning\" as one of their research areas.\n* Course 108 (Artificial Intelligence) is taught by teacher 7, who also has \"Data Mining\" and \"Software Engineering\" as their research areas. However, since \"Machine Learning\" is not explicitly mentioned for this course, we cannot conclude that it's directly related to Machine Learning.\n\nHowever, we can find another course that might be relevant:\n\n* Course 104 (Advanced Algorithms) is taught by teacher 4, who has \"Algorithms Optimization\" as one of their research areas. Although \"Machine Learning\" is not explicitly mentioned for this course or teacher, Advanced Algorithms is a field closely related to Machine Learning.\n\nNow, let's look at the students enrolled in these courses:\n\n* Student 1 (Lucas Schmidt) is enrolled in Course 104 (Advanced Algorithms).\n* Student 4 (Lucas Schmidt) has completed his thesis on Autonomous Systems, which is not directly related to Machine Learning. However, since he was enrolled in Course 104 (Advanced Algorithms), we can assume that he might have some knowledge of Machine Learning concepts.\n\nIn conclusion, the students enrolled in courses related to Machine Learning are:\n\n1. Student 1 (Lucas Schmidt) - enrolled in Course 104 (Advanced Algorithms)\n\nPlease note that this answer is based on the provided context and might not be exhaustive or accurate if more data were available."
